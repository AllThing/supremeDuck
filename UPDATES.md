-implemented 2-way communication so now the arduino tells the mobile app about its current language setting and whether it uses "MultiLang" method  
-added built in web browser so it's possible to search funny images around the internet and copy url by a button (there's also a button to extract Youtube video ID that is currently in the browser)  
-fixed small bug regarding "MultiLang" method (upper case were not affected by it till now)
